# Let's practice 
Before you start: 
1. Create a github acccount. 
2. check that you have git installed: </br>
3. Open the git bash application (we will be using gitBash to write git command throughout the tutorial) </br>
## :warning:This week's deliverables 
Completing assignments *Part I* and *Part II* is compulsory. </br>
This is your deliverable for the week. </br>
It is very important to complete it, demonstrating git skills is part of the minimum learning outcomes for CS2001. </br>
As a bonus, you will also get a git batch to display on your giuthub page :octocat:  </br>
For your deliverable to be accepted you have to: 
* Step 1: Complete the assignment in Part I 
  * Make sure that your file is added to the COLLABORATORS folder of the Git-it repository, 
  hence your PullRequest has to be accepted. 
* Step 2: Complete the assignment in Part II. Make sure you have pushed your changes 
and the file with your student id is in the repository. 

## Part I: Basic git skills   
The purpose of this exercise it to practice basic git commands, and to learn about Pull Requests. </br>
We will be using an application, called [Git-It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron). </br>
This is just an application that makes git tutorials easy. </br>
To complete this exercise you have to complete all challenges from the Git-it application. </br>
Let's get started, follow the steps below. </br>
* Step 1:  Install the [Git-It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases) application
   * Install it form [here](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases)
   * Click and download the .zip version that corresponds to your operating system! (do not download the source code)
   * If you are struggling, read the install instructions [here](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron#what-to-install) 
* Step 2: Start the application 
* Step 3: Complete all challenges  

## Part II: Clone, Add, Commit, Pull, Push! 
In this exercise, you will have to clone an existing application, create a file and 
modify an existing file. </br>
Let's get strated, follow the steps below: </br>
* __Step 1:__ Accept the assignment invitation from this [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/38k1-dLf) </br>
   Accepting the invitation will create a copy of the repository for you. </br>
   The name of the assignement repository will be something like: git-lab-yourusername  </br>
   In the above yourUserName will be your actual github name </br>
   The link to your repository will be: https://github.com/BrunelCS/git-lab-yourUserName </br>
   Again, note that yours will have the same naming convention but instead of yourUserName, there will be your github username </br>
* __Step 2:__ Clone the repository from the assignment link above, use the git clone command
    * Open gitBash </br>
    * Clone the repository. 
  ``` git clone https://github.com/BrunelCS/git-lab-yourusername ``` </br>
  The above assumes that the name of your repository is https://github.com/BrunelCS/git-lab-yourusername, 
    * Move inside the repository folder </br>
  ```cd git-lab-yourusername ```
* __Step 3:__ Open the file HelloWorld.java and modify the text to say: "I am a git master". 
* __Step 4:__ Add a new file, the name of the file should be your student id
  * For example, if your student name is 191827, then add a file with the name 191827.txt
  * Make sure that the file is in the root directory, the same directory where the readme file is
  * Do not put your file in the src directory
* __Step 5:__ Add content to the file. The content should be: Hello, my name is [Put your name here].
* __Step 6:__ Commit and push your changes to your repository assignment. 

## Part III: :feet: Git hunt: a treasure hunt game with Git
Now when we know the basics of git, let's have some fun with it. </br>
We will play a treasure hunt game. </br>
Let's get started. Follow this [link](https://github.com/git-game/git-game) </br>
The game is hard, you really have to be a git master to complete it. </br>
Feel free to ask for help and to work together. </br>
To make things more fun, we will start a little competition. </br> 
There are prizes (git stickers) for whoever manages to complete it! Good luck!</br>
You will also be listed on the lab page as Gitter of the week! </br>


## Part IV: Finally, it is time to test your git knowledge
* Test your git knowledge [here](https://learn.co/lessons/git-github-learn-quiz)
* Make sure that you can: 
  * contribute to an existing repository ([hint](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#github)) 
  * start a new repository and publish it on git ([hint](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#github))
  * contribute to an existing branch  ([hint](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#github))
